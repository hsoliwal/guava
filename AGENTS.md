# Guava agent instructions

## Clean output rule (owner directive, 2026-11-14) - read first

This rule overrides any older text in this file.

- This fork is clean output: one coherent Guava repository. M3 work lives
  inside the project's own classes and packages, written the way the project
  writes its code. It is not stamped across folders.
- Do not add `m3/`, `.m3/`, `docs/m3/` or `tools/m3*` folders.
- Do not add any of the following. They belong in `hsoliwal/com.synexia`, the
  convergence workspace:
  - qualification bundles;
  - evidence, receipts and benchmark tables;
  - work orders;
  - donor copies;
  - recipe sources or recipe resources.
- Do not add parallel `M3`-prefixed types or `*.m3` packages where an existing
  class owns the behaviour. Change that class in place, keep it internal unless
  the owner admits new API, and follow the project's naming.
- A pull request here contains only the product change, plus its tests in the
  project's own test layout. Put the proof material in the paired `com.synexia`
  pull request and link to it.
- This fork's merged pull-request history shows the intended direction.
- Collection forks: arrayify and leetcodify the implementations here, then consolidate them into M3JDK (hsoliwal/M3jdk21), which owns the final implementations.
