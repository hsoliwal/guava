# Array-operation candidate

TopKSelector.trim retains references in the discarded half of its buffer. Both JRE and Android candidates null that suffix only after selection and all comparator callbacks succeed. Comparator calls/exceptions, selected identities, ties, null-aware ordering, combine and immutable result snapshots are preserved.

135,815 checks per version in each JRE and Android source domain; identical comparison/result transcripts. Five fixtures retain 1,067 discarded references before the change and zero after. JMH uses the JRE implementation: fixed-CPU k=1 and k=1024 timing is effectively unchanged within wide intervals.

HELD: time improvement is not proven; this is not accepted as a universal space-and-time optimization. Native Maven compile also stops at missing failureaccess:1.0.3-m3-relocated-20261018. Android-device benchmarks and full native suites are unrun.

The test-only Maven recipes materialized these production files exactly; their hashes are in `source-pins.json`.

All field/method descriptors match the baseline. The standalone Java contract and JMH benchmark are copied unchanged from that canonical packet. Compile against the actual relocated baseline class directory and run with either baseline or candidate-first classpaths. The TopK candidate retention assertion uses `-Dm3.candidate=true`. These witnesses do not stand in for the owning product native Maven suites.

This draft covers the listed owner only. All collection families in all hsoliwal forks remain in scope and incomplete. No default branch is changed and no merge is performed. Upstream source notices and licences remain intact; the new first-party witnesses use Apache-2.0.
